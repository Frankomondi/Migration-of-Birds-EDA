# Migration-of-Birds-EDA
🐦 Project Overview
This project involves performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on bird migration data.
The goal is to uncover patterns, clean the dataset, understand key variables, and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

📂 Dataset
File Name: bird_migration_data.csv

Location: [Local path: C:\Users\dell\OneDrive\Desktop\bird_migration_data.csv]

Description: Contains tracking information on bird migration, such as speed, distance, and other movement attributes.

🛠️ EDA Steps Performed
Loading the Dataset

Read the CSV file using pandas.

Checked basic structure and dimensions of the dataset.

Basic Information

Used .info() and .describe() to understand data types, missing values, and overall statistics.

Missing Values Analysis

Identified columns with missing data.

Planned strategies for handling missing entries where necessary.

Univariate Analysis

Examined distributions of individual features (e.g., histograms, countplots).

Focused on key variables like speed, distance, and bird species.

Bivariate Analysis

Studied relationships between two variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Analyzed how different bird species migrate based on speed and distance.

Data Cleaning

Dropped irrelevant columns if needed.

Handled missing values.

Standardized column names for easier processing.

Outlier Detection

Detected outliers using boxplots.

Outliers can distort averages, affect model performance, and sometimes reveal interesting biological phenomena.

Decision to either keep, transform, or remove outliers based on context.

🎯 Key Learnings
Understanding the Distribution: Most birds followed a fairly normal migration pattern, but a few extreme outliers were identified.

Missing Values: Handled carefully to maintain data integrity.

Importance of Outlier Detection: Helped clean the data and sharpened the analysis.

🚀 Next Steps
Apply feature engineering for more advanced modeling.

Build predictive models to forecast migration patterns.
